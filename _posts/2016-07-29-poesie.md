Yesterday I coded a small soft to give a sequence of words randomly choosen in
the french language.  It was a bit of a non asked challenge by Benny; it was
funny touching again Python3 and its weirdness, although sometimes practical.
The first operable version was done in about two hours (mostly searching for a
base of french words not too crappy)

The list of words is currently saved in `json` for practical reasons.

And it works pretty well on Mac OSⅩ, I still don't know if it works on Windows
(it should… Python3 & json only)

So yeah Yu passed her thesis today, I still don't know if everything went well.

I write a new poem, and printed a new cover for『低俗喜劇』，read few stuff about functional programming. I also found that knowing many words isn't enough to write in chinese, I'm lost when I try to write something, I must work harder ‼␄

title: "女番長ロック，闇に散る花弁〔Sukeban Rock〕English subtitles"
---

Here it is after few years of not working on it all the time.
For the first time on earth the english subtitles for the movie

[『女番長ロック，闇に散る花弁』「Sukeban Rock，flower in the dark」](https://gitlab.com/Ryuutei/Sukeban_Rock)

with the original transcript and translation by Tomo❤️.
I corrected the translation to be clearer for understanding,
few adaptations, few clarifications on places and vulgarities, etc.

Although I still miss 5 sentences.

In the repository there are: 
- the subtitles workfile in Unicode Advanced Sub Station（.ass）
- the subtitles in ASCII Subrip（.srt）

I may translate it in french one day…␄

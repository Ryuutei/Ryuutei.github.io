title: "IPython：Rename images with their SHA1 chekcsum"
---

I got lazy, I don't want to rename pictures anymore so I name them with their own sha1 checksum, so I made a really quick script to do that under IPython.

[code language="python"]

{% highlight python %}
def grapimages():
   """return a list of all images in the current folder """
   μ = list()
   tmp = !ls | grep '[PpJjGg][NnPpIi][GgEeFf][Gg]\{0,1\}'

   for ii in tmp:
       if ii.lower().endswith('png') or ii.lower().endswith('jpg') or ii.lower().endswith('jpeg') or ii.lower().endswith('gif'):
           μ.append(ii)

   return μ

def rensha():
   """rename images from the current folder with their own sha1 checksum"""
   χt = ''
   iu = ''

   for ii in grapimages():

       with open(ii, 'rb', ) as φχer:
           χt = sha1(φχer.read()).hexdigest()

       if ii.lower().endswith('jpeg'): # + exception for jpegs
           iu = '{}.jpg'.format(χt)
       else:
           iu = '{}.{}'.format(χt, ii.split('.')[-1])

       ! mv $ii $iu
   print('done.')
{% endhighlight %}

Yes I use IPython's ability to use shell commands to populate python variables. But I told you it's quick "life hack" like those geeks loves to call them

Today I've almost finished my ttytterrc generator in ruby, 

it features:

#. location (if the location is referenced in the dic)
#. generates the filters.
#. generates the list of friends.
#. gen the list of tracked topics.
#. gen. the config for UI colors
#. gen. the listed plugins.
#. and few other options. (still not everything.)

Nothing fancy, in fact it's a really dumb script. But I don't like writing regex in the perl way and my location list is getting bigger.
I'll put it someday on gh.
